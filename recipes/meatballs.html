        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Italian-style meatballs are tender, juicy, and deeply flavorful thanks to a blend of meat, breadcrumbs, aromatics, and cheese. When cooked properly, the inside stays moist and soft while the exterior gets a nice golden crust. They pair wonderfully with pasta, serve well as appetizers, or fit perfectly into sandwiches.</p>
            Their charm comes from simple ingredients that transform into a satisfying dish. Mixed with herbs, parmesan, and onions, the meat develops a savory, comforting taste. Whether simmered in tomato sauce or served on their own, meatballs remain a beloved classic across cuisines.
