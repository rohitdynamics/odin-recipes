        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a layered Italian baked dish known for its comforting richness and deep savory flavor. Each layer blends tender pasta sheets with creamy cheese and a hearty meat sauce, resulting in a warm, satisfying meal perfect for gatherings and weekend dinners. Its golden, bubbling top is one of the most iconic sights in comfort cooking.</p>

The dish has evolved through countless family variations, but the essence remains the same: layers of simple ingredients transformed into something indulgent and timeless.
