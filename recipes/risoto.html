        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Mushroom risoto is creamy, comforting, and rich with earthy flavors. The arborio rice slowly absorbs warm broth, creating a velvety texture while still keeping a slight bite. Sautéed mushrooms add depth and make the dish hearty and satisfying.</p>
            Although risoto requires patience, the result is worth it—a luxurious, restaurant-style dish made with simple ingredients. The combination of butter, parmesan, and mushrooms produces a deep, savory flavor that works well as both a main and a side dish.
